# Cosa-Dolce

The Cosa Dolce teaching support library and examples. This is on-going
work. The teaching lessons start with rewriting of the Arduino
examples with the Cosa core.


# Install

To use this set of lessons, teaching and example sketches, you must
download and install the [Arduino IDE]
(http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (or GCC AVR toolchain) and
[Cosa] (https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa).

Download and unzip the Cosa-Dolce library into your sketchbook
libraries directory. Rename from Cosa-Dolce-master to Dolce.

The Dolce library and examples should be found in the Arduino IDE
File>Sketchbook menu. Open an example sketch. Select the Cosa core by
selecting one of the Cosa boards in the Tools>Board menu.
