# Cosa-Dolce

This is the Cosa Dolce education and teaching support material. The
repository contains tutorial presentations with example sketches.

The lessons start with an introduction to Cosa by rewriting of the
examples sketches found in the Arduino IDE.

To use this set of lessons, teaching and example sketches, you must
download and install the [Arduino IDE]
(http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (or GCC AVR toolchain) and

Download and unzip the Cosa-Dolce library into your sketchbook
directory. Rename from Cosa-Dolce-master to Cosa-Dolce.
